### Local Development

We use [pixi](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi), see [It's time to try out pixi!](https://deploy-preview-102--ericmjl-github-io.netlify.app/blog/2024/8/16/its-time-to-try-out-pixi/) to get started.

```bash
pixi shell
```

**Remark:** The [`nutpie`](https://github.com/pymc-devs/nutpie) package requires [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html), a rust package manager. For installation instructions, see [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).
