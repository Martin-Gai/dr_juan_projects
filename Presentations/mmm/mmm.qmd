## Media Mix Models

::: incremental

- Media Mix Models (MMM) are used by advertisers to measure the effectiveness of their advertising and provide insight in making future budget allocation decisions.

- Media mix models are also used to find the optimal media mix that maximizes the revenue under a budget constraint in the selected time period.

## Funnel Effects: Causality

> “When an ad channel also impacts the level of another ad channel, using a model like in the baseline above, which simultaneously estimate the impact of all ad channels in one equation, will lead to biased estimates.”

. . .

### We need to draw the DAG!

We need to do a causal analysis to define the causal connections (DAG) and fit the model accordingly so that we do not induce biased estimates.

## MMM Modern Approaches: Bayesian Modeling

::: incremental
- Conceptually transparent interpretation of probablity.
- Uncertainty quantification.
- Allows to explicitly include prior knowledge in the model.
- Felxible and suited for many applications in academia and industry.
