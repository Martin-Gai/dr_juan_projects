# Bayesian Methods in Modern Marketing Analytics Meetup

**Abstract:** During the webinar, we will discuss some of the most crucial topics in marketing analytics: media spend optimization through media mix models and experimentation, and customer lifetime value estimation. We will approach these topics from a Bayesian perspective, as it gives us great tools to have better models and more actionable insights. We will take this opportunity to describe our join with PyMC Labs in open-sourcing some of these tools in our brand-new `pymc-marketing` Python package.
