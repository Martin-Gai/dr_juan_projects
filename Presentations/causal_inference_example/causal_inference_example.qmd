## A story about how data science can be used to make bad decisions

::: {.callout-warning title="Not about bad data or bad algorithms"}

The story I am about to tell wonâ€™t be about bad algorithms or bad data. It will be about thinking about data as simply:

## Business Problem

::: incremental

The story begins in a fast-paced startup. The company is growing fast and the marketing team is looking for ways to increase the sales from existing customers by making them buy more.

- The main idea is to unlock the potential of the customer base through incentives, in this case, a discount.

- We of course want to measure the effect of the discount on the customerâ€™s behavior.

- Still, they do not want to waste money giving discounts to users which are not valuable.

:::

## It is  all about ROI {.center}

::: {.callout-important}

Without going into specifics about the nature of the discount, it has been designed to provide a **positive return on investment if the customer buys more than $1\$$ as a result of the discount**.

:::

How can we measure the effect of the discount and make sure our experiment has a positive ROI?

## Campaign Design {.smaller}

::: incremental

- Select a sample of existing customers from the same cohort and a test window of 1 month.

- Look into the historical data of web visits from the last month. The hypothesis is that web visits are a good proxy for the customerâ€™s interest in the product.

- For customers with a high number of web visits, send them a discount.

- There will be a hold-out group that will not receive the discount within the potential valuable customers based on the number of web visits.

- For customers with a low number of web visits, do not send them a discount (the marketing team wants to report a positive ROI, so they do not want to waste money on customers that are not valuable). Still, they want to use them to measure the effect of the discount.

- We also want to use the results of the test to tag loyal customers. These are customers who got a discount (since they showed potential interest in the product) and customers with exceptional sales numbers even if they did not get a discount. The idea is to use this information to target them in the future if the discount strategy is positive.

:::

## The Data

- `visits`: Number of visits to the website during the test window.

- `discount`: Whether the customer received a discount or not.

- `is_loyal`: Whether the customer is loyal or not according to the definition above.

- `sales`: Sales in $\$$ during the test window.

## ATE Estimation: ML Model ðŸ¤–

You folks are trying to make sense of complex relationships by looking at simple plots and summary statistics!

::: {.callout-tip title="ML Approach"}

 Why donâ€™t you try to fit a machine learning model to the data and see what happens? This way **we can simply let the data and the model figure out the relationships between the variables**. We can do a post-processing on the predictions using, for example, partial dependency plots: which show the marginal effect one or two features have on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model.

:::

``` {.python .input}
ml_model = RandomizedSearchCV(
    estimator=GradientBoostingRegressor(),
    param_distributions= ... ,
    ...
)
```

##

::: {.callout-note title="Results"}

According to the machine learning model, the discount does have a positive effect on sales. The relative partial dependency plot hint that the additional sales driven by the discount are around $0.35\$$. This is less than the limit $1\$$ set by the marketing team to obtain a positive ROI.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

Based on the results from the linear model and the machine learning model, the data scientist decided to recommend the following:


::: {.callout-tip title="Recommendations ðŸ¤“"}

**Stop the discount strategy as on average it provides less than 
$1\$$ additional sales, which implies a negative ROI.**

:::

::: {.callout-important title="Wrong!"}

The data simulation process is based on a true ATE of $2\$$.

## Draw the causal DAG

:::

::: {.column width="70%"}

::: incremental

- Both the `discount` (treatment) and `sales` (target) are affected by the number of web `visits` (proxy for customerâ€™s interest in the product). This means that the number of web visits is a **confounder variable**.

- However, the loyalty of the customer is defined by both the discounts and the sales. This means that `is_loyal` is a **collider variable**.

## Automating The Model Specification

``` {.python  code-line-numbers="|1|3-9|11-13|15-25|27-32"}
from dowhy import CausalModel

# define the causal model
model = CausalModel(
    data=data,
    graph=gml_graph,  # <- Input Causal Graph
    treatment="discount",
    outcome="sales",
)

# get backdoor paths (what we need to control for)
model._graph.get_backdoor_paths(nodes1=["discount"], nodes2=["sales"])
> [['discount', 'visits', 'sales']]

# get estimand
estimand = model.identify_effect()

# estimate effect
estimate = model.estimate_effect(
    identified_estimand=estimand,
    method_name="backdoor.linear_regression",  # <- Estimation Method
    target_units="ate",
    test_significance=True,
    confidence_intervals=True,
)

print(
    f"Estimate of causal effect (linear regression): {estimate.value}"
)
print(f"confidence interval: {estimate.get_confidence_intervals()}")
> Estimate of causal effect (linear regression): 1.855502783142704
> confidence interval: [[1.51720297 2.1938026 ]]
