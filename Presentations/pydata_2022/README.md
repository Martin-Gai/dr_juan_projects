# PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022

The slides are generated using [MARP](https://marp.app/). 

It is recommended to use the [marp-cli](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli) to export the slides to pdf or html. In Mac you can get it via 

```bash
brew install marp-cli
```
To export the slides to pdf simply run:

```bash
 marp --pdf --allow-local-files intro_uplift.md
```
