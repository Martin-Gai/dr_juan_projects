# What is Uplift Modeling?

From [Gutierrez, P., & GÃ©rardy, J. Y. (2017). "Causal Inference and Uplift Modelling: A Review of the Literature"](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v67/gutierrez17a/gutierrez17a.pdf)

 > - Uplift modeling refers to the set of techniques used to model the incremental impact of an action or treatment on a customer outcome.
 > - Uplift modeling is therefore both a Causal Inference problem and a Machine Learning one.
